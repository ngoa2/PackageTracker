    <h1>Stage Proposal: Online Order Status Tracker</h1>
    <h2>Problem Description</h2>
    <p>Online shopping has allowed users of the internet to shop for enjoyment and necessities from the comfort of their own home. 
    Nowadays most americans online shop(<a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/183755/number-of-us-internet-shoppers-since-2009/
    https://www.w3schools.com/html/">link</a>). Instead of going into a retail store, people can buy items with a few quick taps from 
    their mobile screen, and with this action our email inboxes get flooded with receipts, shipping notifications, and delivery updates--
    all necessary email notifications for a customer to know the status of their order.    
    </p>
    <p>I find that while email updates are a simple and straightforward solution. There are so many email updates, newsletters, and personal
    emails in a typical email inbox nowadays that it is difficult to keep track of all packages statuses efficiently. Gmail now has the ability
    separates emails into categories (Social, Promotions, Updates, Forums), and for shipping updates, google now includes a button in a message 
    preview textbox, that says track package <a href="https://mutepc.com/2013/05/gmail-makes-tracking-shipments-easier-with-button-in-inbox/">link</a>,
    so a user can have quicker access to the information in the email that they need. These solutions help ameliorate the problem of 
    lost information in a crowded inbox, but searching for pertinent information about orders, and purchases in a crowded inbox is still a task 
    for the many individuals who don’t read through all their email updates and promotions each day.  I believe that a visually intentional web 
    app catered specifically to present purchase receipts and shipment updates available from a user’s email address, would be able to help many
    people keep better track of their online purchases. 
    </p>
    <h2>App Description</h2>
    <p>The users of this application will be people who frequently make online orders and receive multiple order and shipping notifications in 
    their email inbox. With this web app, users will be presented with the status of their order along with pertinent information like the number
    of items, website, order number, etc. The app page will be formatted in a tab format--much like the modern gmail inbox. When a user receives
    a new update on the order through their email, the web app will switch the order status from the ‘recently purchased’ tab to the ‘just shipped’ tab. 
    Additional features of this web app will be monthly statements showing total amounts of money spent on specific websites and services. 
    </p>
    <p>The main purpose of this app will be to allow the user to keep track of the status of specific orders without clutter of email notifications 
    hidden amongst other email messages. With this app, a user will be able to seamlessly manage their online purchases and gain insight on their 
    purchasing habits with a simple click of a button. The point of this web app will be to present information that’s already available to the user 
    in a better  visually communicative way. People will be able to go to this web application for the information they need instead of needlessly 
    sorting through their email for lost information.

    <h3>Contextual Walkthrough</h3>
    <ol>
            <li>User enters home screen and sees a page with three tabs-- recently purchased, shipped, and delivered. The page is defaulted on the 
                recently purchased tab.</li>
            <li>User can see the list of orders they made that haven’t gotten a shipping email update yet on the recently purchased tab. Under this 
                tab the user can get statements on their purchasing total for the month and their total spendings on specific websites.</li>
            <li>The user navigates to the shipped tab and the user can see the orders that haven’t received the delivery email notification yet, and 
                the shipping number is included in the information easily presented to the user.
            </li>
            <li>The user navigates to the delivered tab, and the user can see all the orders that have been delivered.
            </li>
        </ol>
